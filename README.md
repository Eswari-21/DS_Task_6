## Iris Classification Using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the well-known Iris dataset and compares the performance of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers.

## Project Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These samples belong to one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

## The workflow of this project includes:

Loading and exploring the dataset

Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Training two machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Evaluating both models using standard classification metrics

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using:

Accuracy score: Measures the proportion of correct predictions

Confusion matrix: Shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions categorized by class

Classification report: Includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class

## Requirements
To run this project, you need Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

NumPy

pandas

scikit-learn

## How to Run
Install the required libraries.

Run the Python script.

Review the evaluation results printed to the console, comparing the performance of both models.
